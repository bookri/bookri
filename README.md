### **What is Kuri?**

**A group of people come together to contribute a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., monthly).**

**Each month, the pooled amount is awarded to one member, determined through a random draw.**

**This continues until every member has received the pooled amount once, and the system concludes.**

It’s a trusted, community-driven way to save money and access a lump sum when needed.
