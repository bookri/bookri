## A Modern Take on Traditional Savings

### **What is Kuri?**
*Kuri* (or *Chitti*) is a traditional group savings system practiced in Kerala, India. It operates as follows:

|A group of people come together to contribute a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., monthly).|Each month, the pooled amount is awarded to one member, determined through a random draw.|This continues until every member has received the pooled amount once, and the system concludes.|
